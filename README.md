# dash_slicer

A volume slicer for Dash

Create slice views along a given dimension, and allows multiple such
views to be linked, to help with navigation. Supports anisotropic data,
mask overlays, and more.

## Status

This work is marked as alpha - some essential features are still in
development, and some parts of the API may change in future releases.


## Installation

```
$ pip install dash-slicer
```

Dash-slicer depends on Python 3.6+ plus some [dependencies](requirements.txt).


## Usage example

```py
import dash
from dash import html
from dash_slicer import VolumeSlicer
import imageio

app = dash.Dash(__name__, update_title=None)

vol = imageio.volread("imageio:stent.npz")
slicer = VolumeSlicer(app, vol)

app.layout = html.Div([slicer.graph, slicer.slider, *slicer.stores])

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run_server(debug=True, dev_tools_props_check=False)
```

See [the guide](https://dash.plotly.com/slicer) for more examples and explanations.
A complete app that uses dash-slicer is [dash-vocid-xray](https://dash-gallery.plotly.host/dash-covid-xray/)
([source](https://github.com/plotly/dash-sample-apps/blob/master/apps/dash-covid-xray/app.py)).

On every PR, an app with the same name as your branch is deployed to the Dash
playground instance so that you can change whether your changes did not break
the package.

Release procedure:

* Bump version in `__init__.py` (and commit this change).
* Run `git tag v?.? && git push origin v?.?`
* On GH, turn that tag into a release and write release notes.
* Clear the dist dir.

### The VolumeSlicer class

**class `VolumeSlicer(app, volume, *, spacing=None, origin=None, axis=0, reverse_y=True, clim=None, scene_id=None, color=None, thumbnail=True)`**

A slicer object to show 3D image data in Dash. Upon
instantiation one can provide the following parameters:

* `app` (`dash.Dash`): the Dash application instance.
* `volume` (`ndarray`): the 3D numpy array to slice through. The dimensions
  are assumed to be in zyx order. If this is not the case, you can
  use `np.swapaxes` to make it so.
* `spacing` (tuple of `float`): the distance between voxels for each
  dimension (zyx). The spacing and origin are applied to make the slice
  drawn in "scene space" rather than "voxel space".
* `origin` (tuple of `float`): the offset for each dimension (zyx).
* `axis` (`int`): the dimension to slice in. Default 0.
* `reverse_y` (`bool`): whether to reverse the y-axis, so that the origin of
  the slice is in the top-left, rather than bottom-left. Default True.
  Note: setting this to False affects performance, see #12. This has been
  fixed, but the fix has not yet been released with Dash.
* `clim` (tuple of `float`): the (initial) contrast limits. Default the min
  and max of the volume.
* `scene_id` (`str`): the scene that this slicer is part of. Slicers
  that have the same scene-id show each-other's positions with
  line indicators. By default this is derived from `id(volume)`.
* `color` (`str`): the color for this slicer. By default the color
  is a shade of blue, orange, or green, depending on the axis. Set
  to empty string to prevent drawing indicators for this slicer.
* `thumbnail` (`int` or `bool`): the preferred size of low-resolution data
  to be uploaded to the client. If `False`, the full-resolution data are
  uploaded client-side. If `True` (default), a default value of 32 is used.

Note that this is not a Dash Component. The components that make
up the slicer (and which must be present in the layout) are:
`slicer.graph`, `slicer.slider`, and `slicer.stores`.

**method `VolumeSlicer.create_overlay_data(mask, color=None)`**

Given a 3D mask array, create an object that can be used as
output for `slicer.overlay_data`. Set mask to `None` to clear the mask.
The color can be a hex color or an rgb/rgba tuple. Alternatively,
color can be a list of such colors, defining a colormap.

**property `VolumeSlicer.axis`** (`int`): The axis to slice.

**property `VolumeSlicer.clim`**: A `dcc.Store` to be used as Output, representing the contrast
limits as a 2-element tuple. This value should probably not be
changed too often (e.g. on slider drag) because the thumbnail
data is recreated on each change.

**property `VolumeSlicer.extra_traces`**: A `dcc.Store` to be used as an Output to define additional
traces to be shown in this slicer. The data must be a list of
dictionaries, with each dict representing a raw trace object.

**property `VolumeSlicer.graph`**: The `dcc.Graph` for this slicer. Use `graph.figure` to access the
Plotly Figure object.

**property `VolumeSlicer.nslices`** (`int`): The number of slices for this slicer.

**property `VolumeSlicer.overlay_data`**: A `dcc.Store` to be used an Output for the overlay data. The
form of this data is considered an implementation detail; users
are expected to use `create_overlay_data` to create it.

**property `VolumeSlicer.scene_id`** (`str`): The id of the "virtual scene" for this slicer. Slicers that have
the same scene_id show each-other's positions.

**property `VolumeSlicer.slider`**: The `dcc.Slider` to change the index for this slicer. If you
don't want to use the slider, wrap it in a div with style
`display: none`.

**property `VolumeSlicer.state`**: A `dcc.Store` representing the current state of the slicer (present
in slicer.stores). This store is intended for use as State or Input.
Its data is a dict with the fields:

* "index": the integer slice index.
* "index_changed": a bool indicating whether the index changed since last time.
* "xrange": the view range (2 floats) in the x-dimension (2D).
* "yrange": the view range (2 floats) in the y-dimension (2D).
* "zpos": the float position aling the axis, in scene coordinates.
* "axis": the axis (int) for this slicer.
* "color": the color (str) for this slicer.

The id of the store is a dictionary so it can be used in a
pattern matching Input. Its field are: context, scene, name.
Where scene is the scene_id and name is "state".

**property `VolumeSlicer.stores`**: A list of `dcc.Store` objects that the slicer needs to work.
These must be added to the app layout. Note that public stores
like `state` and `extra_traces` are also present in this list.



### Reacting to slicer state

It is possible to get notified of updates to slicer position and
view ranges. To get this for all slicers with a specific scene_id, create
a [pattern matching input](https://dash.plotly.com/pattern-matching-callbacks)
like this:
```py
Input({"scene": scene_id, "context": ALL, "name": "state"})
```

See the `state` property for details.


### Setting slicer positions

To programatically set the position of the slicer, create a `dcc.Store` with
a dictionary-id that has the following fields:

* 'context': a unique name for this store.
* 'scene': the scene_id of the slicer objects to set the position for.
* 'name': 'setpos'

The value in the store must be an 3-element tuple (x, y, z) in scene coordinates.
To apply the position for one dimension only, use e.g `(None, None, x)`.


### Performance tips

There tends to be a lot of interaction in an application that contains
slicer objects. To realize a smooth user experience, performance matters.
Here are some tips to help with that:

* Most importantly, when running the server in debug mode, consider setting
  `dev_tools_props_check=False`.
* Also consider creating the `Dash` application with `update_title=None`.
* Setting `reverse_y` to False negatively affects performance. This will be
  fixed in a future version of Plotly/Dash.
* For a smooth experience, avoid triggering unnecessary figure updates.
* When adding a callback that uses the slicer position, use the (rate limited)
  `state` store rather than the slider value.
